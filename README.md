Take the To Do List from assignment 1 and convert it to a 3-tier architecture: Web page, server code, database.
I will use the XAMPP package so that it can all be run on a PC. Use one simple database table to store To Do List.
Required functionality: 
* Display a list of tasks
* Add one task
* Complete a task
* Delete a task
* Stores the tasks (persistence not required)
