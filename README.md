Take the To Do List from assignment 1 and convert it to a 3-tier architecture: Web page, server code, database.
I will use the XAMPP package so that it can all be run on a PC. Use one simple database table to store To Do List.
Required functionality: 
*Display a list of tasks
*Add one task
*Complete a task
*Delete a task
*Stores the tasks (persistence not required)
